# Branch p3serves

Hospitalist client and patients database servers are served by a minimal node.js server.

`cd hospitaldb && node server.js`


# Development

Install [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli).

To run a live development server, `npm run dev`
# Deployment

To run a production server, `npm run serve`

This repo is a template. A hospital would fork the repo, and customize the interface to their need. The hospital LAN's DNS will route users to the web app.
