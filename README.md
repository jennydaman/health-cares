# Branch p3serves

Hospitalist client and patients database servers are both going to be standard zero-config web apps.

`python3 -m http.server`

# Development

Install [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli).

To run a live development server, `npm run dev`
# Deployment

This repo is a template. A hospital would fork the repo, and customize the interface to their need. The hospital LAN's DNS will route users to the web app.
